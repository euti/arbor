# about this app

This app allows the user to manage personal information locally in the browser, using no server to storage it.

The information is managed as branches from a tree, where the trunk branch has as many branches inside as you want and those ones recursively too.

# used libraries

- For app state managing: [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- For visual components: [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- For local storage: [Dexie.js](https://dexie.org/)
